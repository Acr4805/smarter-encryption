2. Create a bug report [issue](https://github.com/duckduckgo/smarter-encryption/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

# Feature requests

There are two ways to submit feedback:
1. You can send anonymous feedback using the "Send feedback" link on the extension's options page.
2. You can submit your request as an [issue](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). First check to see if the feature has not already been [suggested](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension/issues).

# Development

## New features

Right now all new feature development is handled internally.

## Bug fixes

Most bug fixes are handled internally, but we will except pull requests for bug fixes if you first:
1. Create an issue describing the bug. see [Reporting bugs](CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs)
2. Get approval from DDG staff before working on it. Since most bug fixes and feature development are handled internally, we want to make sure that your work doesn't conflict with any current projects.
